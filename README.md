## Log

### Day 1: April 8, 2020 - Wednesday

#### Progress

- Published my first NPM package [bpm-counter](https://github.com/johanbaaij/bpm-counter) using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release). Releases and versioning are automatically taken care of by this [GitHub action](https://github.com/johanbaaij/bpm-counter/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml)
- Initialized this repository

#### Thoughts

- Some benefits of automated semantic-releases:
  - Forces you to treat `master` as if it may only contain deployable code
  - Takes the guesswork out of versioning
  - Sets up your repo for easy contributing and use in the real world
- It never ceases to amaze me how many tools and infrastructure is available for open source software
